// DIRECTIVES
// v-on - shorthand: @ --> i.e: @click=""

// conditional rendering
// v-if, v-else  --> the element is removed from the DOM completely - more time consuming and expensive in terms of performance
// v-show - CSS based --> hides the element - better performance for elements that change often

// methods inherit the event object automatically
